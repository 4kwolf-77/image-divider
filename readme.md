To divide an image into 100 equal parts using Python, you can use the PIL (Pillow) library for image processing. Below is an example code that takes an image and divides it into a 10x10 grid:

Here's how the code works:

divide_image function takes the path of the image, number of rows, and number of columns as input.

    It opens the image using PIL and calculates the dimensions of each part based on the number of rows and columns.

    It then iterates through the grid, cropping the image to create 100 parts.

    The resulting parts are returned as a list of PIL.Image.Image objects.

    In the example provided, it saves each part as a separate image file (part_0.jpg, part_1.jpg, ...).

Please replace "path_to_your_image.jpg" with the actual path of your image. Keep in mind that the image should be large enough to be divided into 100 equal parts.

Make sure you have the PIL library installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip install pillow.
